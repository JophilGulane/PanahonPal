## Branding & Naming

* App name: **PanahonPal**
* Logo idea: simple cloud + sun icon combined with a small campus pin/drop to emphasize local focus.
* Color palette suggestion: teal/blue (trust, calm) + warm accent (sun/yellow) + high-contrast neutrals.

## Accessibility & Localization

* Provide Tagalog/English toggles for UI and alert messages.
* Use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and focus management for keyboard navigation.
* Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards.

## Roadmap / Future Ideas

* Integrate official PAGASA advisories and localized flood maps.
* Add class-schedule integration so users get alerts based on their timetable.
* Offline mode with cached last-known forecast.
* Integrate community reports (optional) — let students submit quick on-campus weather notes.
